    <section>What is Reiki?
        <p>Orgiginating from Japan in the early 20th century, Reiki is a form of energy healing. Reiki comes from the
            Japanese word "REI" meaning universal and "KI" meaning life energy. The idea is that we all have "life force
            energy" that flows through our
            bodies. Practitioners act as a channel accepting energy from the Universe and either by hovering their hands
            over the client's body or gently placing their hands on the client, it is then the client
            receives the energy through the practitioners hands, aiding in healing by promoting deep relaxation,reducing
            stress/anxiety and relieving pain.
